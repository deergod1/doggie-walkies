// Render resolution that follows the frame rate (render/resolution.js applies it). On a high-DPI
// screen the GPU shades up to four pixels per CSS pixel; when frames come too slowly because of
// that, the resolution steps down, and creeps back up after a while of smooth frames.
//   - The anti-aliasing is not a step: it stays as the settings say (render/msaa.js: a new number
//     of samples rebuilds every pipeline, seconds of frozen frames).
//   - Frames are judged a second at a time (its hitches left out: steady), by the time between frames and by how much of it the
//     frame's own work (JavaScript, handing the draws to the GPU) took: slow frames that are
//     mostly that work are CPU-bound, and fewer pixels would not help.
//   - Every step down has to prove itself: if the next second is not clearly faster (a CPU-bound
//     frame after all, or a browser that caps the frame rate, like Safari in low power mode), it
//     is taken back and stepping down rests for a while.
//   - Stepping up again waits for a calm spell, twice as long each time a step up had to be taken
//     back right away, so the resolution does not see-saw.
//   - Under a frame rate cap (the settings, game/settings.js) frames are judged against the cap:
//     30 frames a second that were asked for are not slow.
//   - With the lighting on Auto (game/quality.js) the quality level is a step too (`levels` above
//     the lowest, `level` the one now). Down: the level first, then the resolution; slow frames
//     that are CPU-bound take only the level down (fewer shadow maps drawn is less work for the
//     CPU too). Up: the resolution first, then the level. A level's step is judged a second
//     later than the others (QUALITY_SETTLE): what it changes fades in over half a second.
